This package is intended to be a generic package to be used by a Bukkit plugin to provide
localization support. The routines here are heavily borrowed from Hidendra's LWC and refactored
to be generic in nature such that you should be able to copy these classes into your own
project and be up and running with robust internationalization (i18n) with low effort.

<p>
Below is included a usage example to get you started.

<p>
In your plugin onEnable method, you would instantiate a Locale object like so:

<p>
<code><xmp>
  private Locale locale;
  // ...
  public void onEnable() {
	LocaleConfig localeConfig = new LocaleConfig(
		getConfig().getString("locale", "en"),		// "locale" config option, default "en"
		this,
		"lwc",										// whatever prefix makes sense for your plugin
		getFile(),
		log, logPrefix);							// can be null if you like
	locale = LocaleFactory.getLocale(localeConfig);
  }

  public void sendLocalizedMessage(CommandSender target, String msgKey, Object...args) {
    target.sendMessage(locale.getMessage(msgKey, args));
  }
</xmp></code>

<p>
Then to use your new locale using the utility method defined above:

<code><xmp>
  plugin.sendLocalizedMessage(player, "MESSAGE_YOU_DIED", "killer", killer.getName());
</xmp></code>

<p>  
This would locate the localized string with the key "MESSAGE_YOU_DIED" and replace any
occurrence of "%killer%" in that string with the killer's name.

<p>
Setting up your language files is a matter of including a "lang" directory in your JAR
file with your language definitions, like so:

<code><xmp>
> jar tvf LWC.jar 
     0 Mon Dec 12 03:40:46 PST 2011 lang/
 15019 Sun Dec 11 08:21:12 PST 2011 lang/lwc_cz.properties
 14719 Sun Dec 11 08:21:12 PST 2011 lang/lwc_da.properties
 15897 Sun Dec 11 08:21:12 PST 2011 lang/lwc_de.properties
 15993 Mon Dec 12 03:40:46 PST 2011 lang/lwc_en.properties
 15127 Sun Dec 11 08:21:12 PST 2011 lang/lwc_es.properties
</xmp></code>

<p>
(the "lwc" prefix in this case matches to the pluginBaseName arg supplied to LocaleConfig)

<p>
An example of such a file might look like so:

<code><xmp>
## author: Hidendra

##################
##    General   ##
##################

# Yes/no response (mainly for /lwc info)
yes=%green%Yes
no=%red%No

# Internal LWC error (if this shows up, something went terribly wrong most likely)
protection.internalerror=%red%[LWC] Internal error. Notify an admin immediately.%white% :%id%

# Access denied.
protection.accessdenied=%red%Access denied.
</xmp></code>

<p>
Note that these classes provide the admin the ability to provide their own language override
files in the "plugins/MyPlugin/locale/" directory. In the simplest case, the admin could
just name it "plugin.properties" (where plugin is the name of your prefix, ie. "lwc") and
any messages found in there will override the ones from the language pack in the JAR file.
